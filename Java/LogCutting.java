 * Cutting Sticks 
 * You have to cut a wood stick into pieces. The most affordable
 * company, The Analog Cutting Machinery, Inc. (ACM), charges money according to
 * the length of the stick being cut. Their procedure of work requires that they
 * only make one cut at a time. It is easy to notice that different selections
 * in the order of cutting can led to different prices. For example, consider a
 * stick of length 10 meters that has to be cut at 2, 4 and 7 meters from one
 * end. There are several choices. One can be cutting first at 2, then at 4,
 * then at 7. This leads to a price of 10 + 8 + 6 = 24 because the first stick
 * was of 10 meters, the resulting of 8 and the last one of 6. Another choice
 * could be cutting at 4, then at 2, then at 7. This would lead to a price of 10
 * + 4 + 6 = 20, which is a better price.
 *
 * Your boss trusts your computer abilities to find out the minimum cost for
 * cutting a given stick.
 *
 * Input  *
 * The input will consist of several input cases. The first line of each test
 * case will contain a positive number l that represents the length of the stick
 * to be cut. You can assume l < 1000. The next line will contain the number n
 * (n < 50) of cuts to be made. The next line consists of n positive numbers ci
 * ( 0 < ci < l) representing the places where the cuts have to be done, given
 * in strictly increasing order.
 *
 * An input case with l = 0 will represent the end of the input.
 *
 * Output  *
 * You have to print the cost of the optimal solution of the cutting problem,
 * that is the minimum cost of cutting the given stick. Format the output as
 * shown below. Sample Input  *
 * 100 3 25 50 75 10 4 4 5 7 8 0 Sample Output  *
 * The minimum cutting is 200. The minimum cutting is 22.
